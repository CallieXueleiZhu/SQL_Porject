# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals
The goal of this project is to clean, tranform and analyze the given database using SQL. Useful infromation should be extracted and communicated for the business. 
## Process
### Step 1: Loading files and identifying data types
### Step 2: Cleaning data for missing data, duplicated data and obliviously incorrect data
### Step 3: Analyzing data based on questions
### Step 4: Analyzing data based on the pattern in data

## Results
1. The most revenue comes from San Francisco, US. 
2. US also ranks top in total revenue from each country.
3. The least revenue comes from Zurich.
4. Switzerland ranks last in total revenue from each country.
5. On average, each city orders 2.2 products. 
6. The most ordered product category is under  "Home/Shop by Brand/YouTube/“.
7. There is no oblivious relationship between the time stayed on site and the price of the product. This could mean price was not the main factor for decision of purchase. 


## Challenges 
1. With limited domain knoowledge, a large amount of assumptions need to be made which created a lot of uncertainties in the analyzing process.
2. I did not know how to do statistical analysis for relationship between two columns, whcih prevented me from exploring more for the "Start with Data" section. 

## Future Goals
-Join and compare different tables to make sure columns in each table match. 
-Check each table row by row for any inaccurate data. 
-Gain more domain knowledge instead o making assumptions
